== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need a Mega.nz account? =

Yes, you need a free or paid Mega.nz account. You can sign up at https://mega.nz

= Where are the uploaded files stored? =

Files are uploaded directly to your Mega.nz cloud storage account, not on your WordPress server.

= Is my Mega.nz password secure? =

Yes! Your password is encrypted using AES-256 encryption (military-grade security) and can only be decrypted with access to both your WordPress database and configuration files.

= Can I limit who can upload files? =

Yes! You can restrict uploads by WordPress user role (Administrator, Editor, Author, Contributor, Subscriber) or allow everyone (including non-logged-in visitors).

= Can I restrict file types? =

Yes! You can specify allowed file extensions (e.g., jpg, png, pdf, docx) when creating your shortcode.

= What's the maximum file size? =

You can set custom file size limits for each upload form (from 10MB up to 1GB or custom sizes). The limit depends on your Mega.nz account type and your server's PHP settings.

= Does it work with page builders? =

Yes! The shortcode works with any page builder that supports WordPress shortcodes (Elementor, Divi, Gutenberg, WPBakery, Beaver Builder, etc.).

= Can I have multiple upload forms? =

Yes! You can create unlimited upload forms with different settings, each uploading to different Mega.nz folders.

= Will this slow down my website? =

No! Files are uploaded directly from the user's browser to Mega.nz, bypassing your server entirely. This keeps your server fast and storage-free.
